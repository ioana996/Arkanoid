# Arkanoid
Arkanoid game in Javascript

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Motivation & Description

This Arkanoid game was created as a personal project to practice **vanilla JavaScript**, outside the frameworks I use in my daily work such as **React** and **Next.js**. The main goal was to revisit and strengthen my core JavaScript skills by building an interactive browser game from scratch.

Although there are libraries like [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) that are popular for browser-based game development, I deliberately chose not to use them. Instead, I focused on **pure JavaScript and CSS**, which are more directly relevant to my day-to-day frontend development work.

For the same reason, all visual styling and layout are handled using **plain CSS**, without the use of canvas or WebGL. This allowed me to refine layout techniques and practice styling elements through dynamic DOM manipulation.

### ðŸ§ª Gameplay Features

- Ball movement at fixed 45Â° angles
- Paddle controlled with keyboard input
- Collision detection for bricks, walls, and paddle
- Game restart functionality
- Life tracking system (with game over)
- Single static brick layout (no level progression)

The project uses a modular JavaScript structure via ES6 modules (`<script type="module">`), with each game component split into its own file for maintainability.

Technologies used:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS3**
- **HTML5**
